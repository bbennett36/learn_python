name = str(input("What's your name? "))
amount_spent = float(input("How much money do you spend on weed in a month? "))

# your projects won't require any if/else statements
if amount_spent > 0:
    print("Congrats " + name +  "! You're a crackhead!")
else:
    print("Congrats " + name +  "! You're not a crackhead!")
